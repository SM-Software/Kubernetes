## Creating Deployment

### YML Masnifest
```
apiVersion: apps/v1   # Refer the doc to know the version 
# We can metion here the replcaset if we are creating the replicaset, 
# but since the dpeloyment will take care of replicaset by themselves we are creating the deployment directly
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: <deployment Name>
  labels:
    app: <app-name>
    tier: <trier-for-mapping>  # Optional
spec:   # Define the specs for the deployment
  selector:   # build a relation between the pod and the Depoyment using the match labels: app
    matchLabels:
      tier: <tier-if-provided for match> 
  template:   # Define the pod specification below the template, in the same file or refer to the pod.yml separately
    metadata:
      name: <Pod-NAme>
      labels:
        tier: <tier name to be mapped>
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: <container name>
        image: <Image>
```

### Applying resource limits in the pod
```
apiVersion: apps/v1   # Refer the doc to know the version 
# We can metion here the replcaset if we are creating the replicaset, 
# but since the dpeloyment will take care of replicaset by themselves we are creating the deployment directly
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: <deployment Name>
  labels:
    app: <app-name>
    tier: <trier-for-mapping>  # Optional
spec:   # Define the specs for the deployment
  selector:   # build a relation between the pod and the Depoyment using the match labels: app
    matchLabels:
      tier: <tier-if-provided for match> 
  template:   # Define the pod specification below the template, in the same file or refer to the pod.yml separately
    metadata:
      name: <Pod-NAme>
      labels:
        tier: <tier name to be mapped>
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: <container name>
        image: <Image>
        ports:
        - containerPort: <port to run on>
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: <Memory that this pod can use>
            cpu: <CPU limits>
```

### Run the deployment
```
kubectl create -f <file-name> --save-config
```

### Scaling the deployment from cmd
```
kubectl scale -f <file-name> --replicas=4
```

### Rolling update
- The kubernetes bydefault apply the rolling update deployment.
