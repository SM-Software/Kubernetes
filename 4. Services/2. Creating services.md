## Creating Services

### Creating service with KubeCtl

#### Port Forwarding
- The port forward can be use to map the local port to the Kubernetes port.
- Below are the few sample commands to achieve that

```
# Listen to port 8080 locally and forward to port 80 in pod
kubectl port-forward pod/[Pod-Name] 8080:80

# Listen to port 8080 locally and forward to deployment pod
kubectl port-fordward deployment/[deployment-name] 8080

# Listen on port 8080 locally and forward to service's pod
kubectl port-forward service/[service-name] 8080
```
