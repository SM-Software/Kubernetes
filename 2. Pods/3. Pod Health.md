## Pod Health

### Probes in kubernetes
- Kubernetes relies on Probes to determine the health of the pod container.
- Probe is a diagnostic performed periodically by the kubelet on a container.

### Types of Probe
- Libeness probes: Can be used to determine of a pod is healthy and running as expected.
- Readiness Probes: can be used to determine if a pod should recieve requests

### Probes command
- ExecAction: executes an action inside the container
- TCPSocketAction: TCP checks against the container's IP address on a specified port.
- HTTPGetAction: HTTP GET request against container

Probes can have the following results:
- Success 
- Failure
- Unknown

### Defining probes in yaml

#### Liveness Probe with HttpGet request
- For the sample health probe definition with nginx image, refer [this](./yaml%20manifests/2.%20liveness-healthprobe.pod.yaml)

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: [Pod-Name]
  labels:
    app: [App-Name]
spec:
  containers:
    name: [ContainerName]
    image: [Image-Name]
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /index.html # Can put a custom api for health check
        port: 80  # Check index.html on port 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 15   # Wait for 15 seconds for the response
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      periodSeconds: 5 # Check every 5 seconds
      failureThreshold: 1  # Allow 1 failure before failing the pod
```

#### Liveness probe with Exec Action
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: [Pod-Name]
  labels:
    app: [App-Name]
spec:
  containers:
    name: [ContainerName]
    image: [Image-Name]
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - <command 1>
        - <command 2>
      initialDelaySeconds: 15   # Wait for 15 seconds for the response
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      periodSeconds: 5 # Check every 5 seconds
      failureThreshold: 1  # Allow 1 failure before failing the pod
```

#### Defining readiness probes with HttpGet Action
- For the sample health probe definition with nginx image, refer [this](./yaml%20manifests/3.%20rediness-healthprobe.pod.yml)
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: [Pod-Name]
  labels:
    app: [App-Name]
spec:
  containers:
    name: [ContainerName]
    image: [Image-Name]
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /index.html
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 2
      periodSeconds: 5
```

### Which probe should be used
- IF we want to determine when a pod should start recieving the requests we should use the readiness porbe
- If we want to determine when a container should restart we should use the liveness probe

- IF we want both readiness and liveness probe in action we can use both in the same yaml file. To see how to use both the probes check [this](./yaml%20manifests/4.%20nginx-liveness-and-readiness-probe.pod.yml) out.
